        QuantumFront was ORIGINALLY created as a tech–finance front by El Patrón
        (Raphael) and Carlos purely for accounting fraud—inflating valuations of
        "quantum R&D" to launder cartel money through fabricated tech investments.
        The public campus at Seaview Research Park exists for PR, hiring, and
        audit-facing compliance theater. The cartel had NO intention of actually
        building quantum capability; "Quantum" was just a buzzword to justify cash flows.

        TURNING POINT: When Sumin secured NSA funding (Miller's $2M/year offer),
        El Patrón initially STRONGLY OPPOSED it—outside attention threatened their
        laundering operation. But as Sumin's research showed genuine RSA-breaking
        potential, El Patrón's strategic mind recognized a far greater opportunity:
        the technology itself could become an instrument of power worth more than
        any laundering scheme. The cartel pivoted from "fake quantum for money
        laundering" to "real quantum as geopolitical weapon."

        This pivot was accelerated by the fact that the Novagrad Freeport already
        housed the cartel's security/logistics team (LST) for processing and
        blocking illegal operations at the port. The existing LST infrastructure +
        quantum computing potential created a synergy the cartel couldn't ignore.

        The real program now runs inside a Novagrad Freeport underground site
        (harbor_underground_lab). The underground operation evolved from pure
        laundering to: (1) targeted key recovery/exfiltration using hybrid quantum,
        (2) leveraging quantum capability for geopolitical negotiation power, and
        (3) building a permanent "mutual assured dependence" structure with state actors.

    - content: |
        The capability is not “a quantum computer that cleanly breaks RSA-2048.”
        The pipeline is hybrid:
        (A) LST-derived access to HSM test keys / partial key material / routing
            disruption reduces the remaining entropy,
        (B) Moreno’s real-time phase-tracking plus Phase-Guard stabilization enables
            the QPU to recover specific classes of keys on minute-scale timelines.
        The real power is targeted key recovery/exfiltration, not a generalized Q-Day.

    - content: |
        The NSA (Miller line) is not prioritizing “taking down the cartel.”
        Their objectives are:
        (1) force early access to selected keys/channels to secure national-security advantage,
        (2) if needed, desynchronize FBI timing and procedure,
        (3) then seal the matter under “national security” to control disclosure.
        The cartel backchannel is not “hostile coexistence” but a constrained,
        mutually beneficial transaction that remains deniable.

    - content: |
        Yonas Mehret is not a simple floor operator. He is the physical–digital bridge
        for the LST/SCADA line, translating demands from multiple organizations into
        on-the-ground execution. His legal identity / travel record is intentionally
        incomplete. The “last ten minutes” around Elena’s shooting—lockdown sequence,
        CCTV gap, and corridor routing—was engineered by Yonas.

    - content: |
        Before her death, Elena partially implemented a deadman architecture that can
        auto-release CryoLab logs and evidence externally. One release condition
        (time / NTP drift / key threshold) was deliberately sabotaged so the material
        does not spill immediately. The broken deadman becomes later leverage in
        bargaining and coercion.

    - content: |
        Moreno’s death is a near-assassination staged to look like accidental overwork.
        Medical access was constrained, RF noise and nitrogen-steam stressors were used,
        and lockdown pressure was applied to prevent a safe stop. The psychological threat
        “If you halt, your family pays” removed voluntary termination as an option.
        The final narrative is pre-framed so that Sumin’s non-stop run becomes a
        moral/legal stain—complicity by design.

    - content: |
        The Mock Q-Day (EP30) is a cartel DISINFORMATION operation: using conventional
        hacking (leaked HSM test keys, BGP/DNS manipulation, botnet amplification) to
        create the ILLUSION that quantum computing has already broken RSA, without
        actually using the quantum computer. The purpose is to generate panic (financial
        markets, government response) and use that panic as negotiation leverage BEFORE
        the real QPU demo. The cartel controls both "rails": the Narrative Rail (fake
        fear) and the Quantum Rail (real technology), and synchronizes them with a
        precisely calculated 17-second phase offset.

    - content: |
        The three U.S. intelligence agencies are in ACTIVE CONFLICT with each other:
        - FBI (Sophia): Prioritizes legal prosecution, evidence chains, grand jury.
          Limited by procedure. Wants to dismantle the cartel through courts.
        - NSA (Miller): Prioritizes technology acquisition and national-security
          monopoly. Willing to work WITH the cartel via backchannel if it means
          controlling the quantum pipeline. Actively undermines FBI timing.
        - CIA (Ethan): Prioritizes geopolitical balance and cross-border finance.
          Uses Yonas as a double agent inside the cartel. Seeks to prevent ANY
          single faction (including NSA) from monopolizing the technology.
        This inter-agency conflict is as dangerous to Sumin as the cartel itself.

    - content: |
        Sumin's Failsafe-B system embodies THREE levels of balance simultaneously:
        (1) POLITICAL balance: cartel vs. government—no single faction can monopolize
            the quantum capability without the others' cooperation (3-of-5 key sharing).
        (2) TECHNICAL balance: the 72-hour re-authentication + deadman switch ensures
            no one can eliminate Sumin without triggering mutual destruction.
        (3) PHILOSOPHICAL balance: Sumin's evolving understanding that "technology is
            a hand, not a knife"—the same system that can break RSA can also prevent
            its misuse, depending on who controls it and how.
        The Failsafe is simultaneously Sumin's prison and his only protection.

    - "Novagrad Freeport is a fictional U.S. port free-zone rumored to have looser logistics, customs, and audit boundaries."
    - "Some QuantumFront equipment, cryogenic components, and large racks move through Freeport logistics for 'offsite integration testing.'"
    - "Greyshore Capital repeatedly appears around QuantumFront as an investment/escrow partner, but its true structure is opaque."

    - "Terms like 'Phase-Guard', 'Failsafe', and 'BRIDGE_SLOT' circulate internally, but official documentation is selectively shared."
    - "Institutional incentives differ: the FBI prioritizes procedure/evidence/prosecution, the CIA prioritizes external balance/deals, the NSA prioritizes national-security advantage, and the port floor prioritizes keeping operations running."
