        QuantumFront is not a legitimate “research company” but a tech–finance front
        architected by El Patrón (Raphael) and Carlos. The public campus at Seaview
        Research Park exists for PR, hiring, and audit-facing compliance theater.
        The real program runs inside a Novagrad Freeport underground site
        (harbor_underground_lab). The underground operation is less about “science”
        and more about: (1) laundering justification for capital flows, (2) evading
        sanctions/freezes, and (3) building leverage over crypto and communications.

    - content: |
        The capability is not “a quantum computer that cleanly breaks RSA-2048.”
        The pipeline is hybrid:
        (A) LST-derived access to HSM test keys / partial key material / routing
            disruption reduces the remaining entropy,
        (B) Moreno’s real-time phase-tracking plus Phase-Guard stabilization enables
            the QPU to recover specific classes of keys on minute-scale timelines.
        The real power is targeted key recovery/exfiltration, not a generalized Q-Day.

    - content: |
        The NSA (Miller line) is not prioritizing “taking down the cartel.”
        Their objectives are:
        (1) force early access to selected keys/channels to secure national-security advantage,
        (2) if needed, desynchronize FBI timing and procedure,
        (3) then seal the matter under “national security” to control disclosure.
        The cartel backchannel is not “hostile coexistence” but a constrained,
        mutually beneficial transaction that remains deniable.

        Yonas Mehret is not a simple floor operator. He is the physical–digital bridge
        for the LST/SCADA line, translating demands from multiple organizations into
        on-the-ground execution. His legal identity / travel record is intentionally
        incomplete. The “last ten minutes” around Elena’s shooting—lockdown sequence,
        CCTV gap, and corridor routing—was engineered by Yonas.

    - content: |
        Before her death, Elena partially implemented a deadman architecture that can
        auto-release CryoLab logs and evidence externally. One release condition
        (time / NTP drift / key threshold) was deliberately sabotaged so the material
        does not spill immediately. The broken deadman becomes later leverage in
        bargaining and coercion.

    - content: |
        Moreno’s death is a near-assassination staged to look like accidental overwork.
        Medical access was constrained, RF noise and nitrogen-steam stressors were used,
        and lockdown pressure was applied to prevent a safe stop. The psychological threat
        “If you halt, your family pays” removed voluntary termination as an option.
        The final narrative is pre-framed so that Sumin’s non-stop run becomes a
        moral/legal stain—complicity by design.

  # ── Public facts ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # All agents are aware of these from the start.
  public:
    - "The year is 2043. Quantum computing has advanced, but remains fragile—extremely sensitive to cryogenics, vibration, EMI, and measurement-chain latency."
    - "QuantumFront maintains a public campus at Seaview Research Park and presents itself as a private R&D organization working on 'next-generation quantum/security.'"
    - "Novagrad Freeport is a fictional U.S. port free-zone rumored to have looser logistics, customs, and audit boundaries."
    - "Some QuantumFront equipment, cryogenic components, and large racks move through Freeport logistics for 'offsite integration testing.'"
    - "Greyshore Capital repeatedly appears around QuantumFront as an investment/escrow partner, but its true structure is opaque."
    - "Key figures include: Kim Sumin (quantum physicist), Elena Ramirez (technical lead), Dr. Alex Moreno (phase-tracking authority and Sumin’s mentor), Yonas Mehret (port-line operator), and Carlos Reyes (operations/pressure)."
    - "Terms like 'Phase-Guard', 'Failsafe', and 'BRIDGE_SLOT' circulate internally, but official documentation is selectively shared."
    - "Institutional incentives differ: the FBI prioritizes procedure/evidence/prosecution, the CIA prioritizes external balance/deals, the NSA prioritizes national-security advantage, and the port floor prioritizes keeping operations running."
