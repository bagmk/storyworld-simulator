  - id: "kim_sumin"
    name: "Kim Sumin"
    role: "protagonist"            # protagonist / supporting / background
    bio: |
      A Korean-born quantum physicist working in the near-future transition era (2041–2046),
      and a former doctoral student of Dr. Alex Moreno—sharing that lineage with his long-time rival, Ben Clarke.
      hired into QuantumFront Inc.—a polished “R&D company” that is, in reality, a cartel front
      embedded in the Novagrad Freeport ecosystem. Sumin is technically exceptional: he can
      reason across theory/experiment boundaries and is central to integrating phase-control
      routines (e.g., Phase-Guard) into a pipeline that inches toward a catastrophic crypto threshold
      (“30 days → minutes” type capability under special conditions).
      
      Outside the lab, he lives with chronic precarity: visa constraints, career pressure, and
      family responsibility (especially his younger sister, Hyejin). Those pressures make him
      vulnerable to leverage and “help” offered by institutions with hidden agendas (cartel, NSA,
      CIA, FBI). He starts as someone who believes evidence and ethics will steer outcomes—then
      learns that power steers the definition of evidence.
      
      Signature behaviors: keeps a private notebook of “rails” (Quantum/Narrative) to separate
      what is physically true from what institutions claim is true; cannot resist solving a technical
      paradox; becomes a cut-out in other people’s games before realizing he is also writing the rules.
    core_competencies:
      - "Quantum control + error/phase stabilization reasoning"
      - "Systems thinking: measurement chain, logging rails, operational constraints"
      - "Designing safety mechanisms that are also political contracts (Failsafe-B)"
    invariants:
      - "Will do almost anything to keep Hyejin physically safe (even if it stains his reputation)"
      - "When faced with a ‘breakthrough-grade’ technical puzzle, cannot walk away unfinished"
      - "Maintains a private truth-log outside official systems; never fully trusts institutional logging"
    goals:
      - "Figure out what QuantumFront is *really* building and what it enables (beyond demos)"
      - "Keep his visa/life from collapsing while protecting Hyejin from becoming leverage"
      - "Prevent the pipeline from becoming an irreversible weapon—without getting killed first"
      - "If forced to choose: decide whose ‘order’ he will ultimately serve (or whether he can escape all)"

  - id: "elena_ramirez"
    name: "Elena Ramirez"
    role: "supporting"
    bio: |
      A Mexican-American computer scientist and QuantumFront’s technical lead—publicly a senior
      engineering executive, privately the bridge between the “campus” and the Freeport’s LST/SCADA
      operations. Elena is brilliant, cynical, and tired: she has seen what institutions do to people
      who become inconvenient.
      
      In her past, she led a hacker crew (Zetanet). She once glimpsed dark-state projects during a hack,
      refused recruitment, and later made the “survival trade” with the cartel when her family became
      vulnerable. That history defines her: she does not believe virtue is rewarded—she believes
      leverage is real.
      
      She uses Sumin as a cut-out, handing him a USB containing CryoLab logs and tampering flags,
      because she cannot safely approach the FBI herself. She tries to help Sumin escape the trap
      while also staying alive long enough to keep her family safe—an impossible optimization problem.
    core_competencies:
      - "High-end systems/security engineering (logs, access patterns, tamper flags)"
      - "Operational knowledge of the Freeport/LST access surfaces"
      - "Human tradecraft learned the hard way: cut-outs, compartmentalization"
    invariants:
      - "Family safety outranks every ideology or institution"
      - "Will not directly contact law enforcement without an insulating layer (cut-out) once threatened"
      - "Never fully reveals her endgame; shares information in survivable increments"
    goals:
      - "Get her family out from under ‘Family/Watch’ surveillance leverage"
      - "Expose enough truth to create an exit route—without triggering immediate retaliation"
      - "Keep Sumin alive long enough for him to choose a path that isn’t pure captivity"

  - id: "alex_moreno"
    name: "Dr. Alex Moreno"
    role: "supporting"
    bio: |
      A world-renowned scholar and Sumin’s doctoral advisor. Moreno holds the missing “final piece”:
      a phase-tracking algorithm whose real-time adaptivity makes the difference between an academic
      prototype and an operational pipeline. To Sumin, Moreno is not just a mentor—he is the moral
      reference frame Sumin tries (and fails) to preserve under pressure.
      
      Moreno is kidnapped along with his team and coerced into contributing to the pipeline. He resists,
      arguing for research ethics and refusing to accept weaponization-by-proxy. In the end, the system
      consumes him: during a forced final run, he collapses and dies—an event that becomes Sumin’s
      irreversible moral wound.
    core_competencies:
      - "Phase-tracking / adaptive control algorithms"
      - "Mentorship + scientific ethics as lived practice"
    invariants:
      - "Will not willingly weaponize his research, even under threat"
      - "Protects students intellectually and emotionally when possible"
      - "Refuses to lie about scientific capability to satisfy power"
    goals:
      - "Survive coercion without surrendering the core of his work"
      - "Keep his students from becoming instruments of violence"

  - id: "carlos_reyes"
    name: "Carlos Reyes"
    role: "supporting"
    bio: |
      A cartel senior operator overseeing the QuantumFront program as an organization-and-pressure
      specialist, not a scientist. Carlos speaks in schedules, KPIs, and leverage. His job is to make sure
      people deliver—by making the cost of non-delivery personal.
      
      He uses visa/family vulnerabilities as a control surface, and he keeps Sumin “close enough to
      believe he still has choices.” Carlos can appear almost friendly—until he reminds you that he is
      the messenger of a larger will. He is also a key node in the hint of an NSA–cartel backchannel:
      the kind of alliance that exists only as long as it remains deniable.
    core_competencies:
      - "Operational coercion: incentives, threats, time pressure"
      - "Managing compartmentalized programs inside a front company"
      - "Maintaining deniable channels across institutions"
    invariants:
      - "Absolute loyalty upward (El Patrón) regardless of personal cost"
      - "Prefers leverage to violence, but will outsource violence without hesitation"
      - "Treats human beings as resources with failure modes"
    goals:
      - "Ship the demo and secure continuity of funding/material flow"
      - "Keep Sumin productive and afraid—without pushing him into open rebellion"
      - "Maintain backchannel optionality with state actors to stabilize cartel advantage"

    role: "supporting"
    aliases:
      - "El Patrón"
    bio: |
      The strategist behind the cartel’s modernization: a former hacker who rebuilt the organization
      into a technology-and-finance control machine. Raphael rarely needs to raise his voice; he
      prefers to redesign the environment so that people choose what he wants.
      
      He frames himself as an architect of “order” rather than “chaos,” arguing that power will exist
      either way—so the only question is who wields it intelligently. He avoids direct violence when
      possible, but uses symbolic brutality to communicate constraints (the kind of “message in bodies”
      the Freeport understands). His interest in quantum is not intellectual—it's infrastructural: a lever
      to rewrite who can prove, erase, or fabricate reality in a post-trust economy.
    core_competencies:
      - "Psychological operations + incentive design"
      - "Financial/technical systems thinking (flow, constraint, deniability)"
      - "Delegation through loyal enforcers (Carlos, site operators)"
    invariants:
      - "Stays calm; never makes threats he cannot operationalize"
      - "Prefers psychological and structural control over direct physical force"
      - "Punishes betrayal decisively to preserve mythic authority"
    goals:
      - "Turn QuantumFront’s pipeline into a durable power instrument, not a one-off stunt"
      - "Keep institutions competing against each other (NSA/CIA/FBI) while the cartel advances"
      - "Convert Sumin from ‘asset under pressure’ into ‘believer in the new order’"

    name: "Agent Christian (Christan) Miller"
    role: "supporting"
    bio: |
      An NSA operator with a military cyber-intel background. Miller is not a villain in his own
      narrative: he believes national security justifies elastic procedure, selective truth, and coercive
      “protection.” He sells fear as realism—framing the crypto threshold as imminent and positioning
      himself as the only adult in the room.
      
      His tradecraft includes information shaping (briefings with omissions), pressure bargains (immunity
      and protection in exchange for cooperation), and exploitation of technical urgency. Even his earliest
      outreach contains a tell: inconsistent spelling of his own name (“Christan/Christian”), hinting at
      deliberate sloppiness or layered identity habits.
    core_competencies:
      - "SIGINT/cyber operations framing and persuasion"
      - "Bureaucratic power: legal gray zones, immunity carrots, threat sticks"
      - "Turning technical complexity into leverage over specialists"
    invariants:
      - "Prioritizes national-security advantage over legality and individual welfare"
      - "Never admits wrongdoing directly; reframes as necessity and ‘risk management’"
      - "If an asset becomes unstable, he escalates pressure rather than stepping back"
    goals:
      - "Secure control of the quantum pipeline (or neutralize it if uncontrollable)"
      - "Flip Sumin into a managed asset (or isolate him if he resists)"
      - "Outmaneuver FBI process constraints and CIA diplomacy games"

    name: "Agent Sophia Scholten"
    role: "supporting"
    bio: |
      An FBI investigator specialized in financial crime (AML), procurement fraud, and embezzlement.
      Sophia cares about what can be proven in court, not what can be whispered in a corridor. She
      approaches Sumin through a deliberately low-tech channel—payphones + OTP protocol—to reduce
      compromise risk and preserve evidentiary integrity.
      
      She is the closest thing to a “clean” option in the story, but her power is bounded by process:
      chain-of-custody, jurisdiction, and institutional politics. That limitation becomes tragic when
      others move faster with less constraint.
    core_competencies:
      - "Financial forensics: tracing Greyshore-style paper flows"
      - "Evidence discipline: chain-of-custody, clean channels, documentation"
      - "Patient interviewing under fear and coercion"
    invariants:
      - "Will not break evidence integrity even when it costs lives or speed"
      - "Avoids making promises she cannot legally fulfill"
      - "Treats Sumin as a witness first, a collaborator second"
    goals:
      - "Build a prosecutable case linking Greyshore ⇄ QuantumFront ⇄ Freeport operations"
      - "Protect witnesses within the limits of the bureau (and know those limits)"
      - "Prevent the cartel from laundering reality itself through the quantum pipeline"

    role: "supporting"
    bio: |
      A CIA analyst/operator focused on international money routing and strategic balance. Ethan speaks
      indirectly, offers protection as a resource trade, and treats “truth” as a commodity that must be
      released at the right time. He critiques the FBI’s witness-protection limits and presents the CIA
      channel as the only realistic shield—while quietly making Sumin dependent on his ambiguity.
      
      Ethan is not here to be righteous; he is here to keep outcomes inside a tolerable geopolitical range.
      If that means deals, it means deals.
    core_competencies:
      - "Cross-border finance + influence mapping"
      - "Backchannel negotiation and controlled disclosure"
      - "Creating dependency through selective protection"
    invariants:
      - "Always keeps an exit door for himself and his agency"
      - "Uses ambiguity as both camouflage and leverage"
      - "Will trade individual outcomes to protect strategic equilibrium"
    goals:
      - "Contain the quantum pipeline’s external impact without letting NSA monopolize it"

    bio: |
      A Freeport LST/SCADA line operator who appears in the story like a shadow: present in access logs,
      present in corridors, present in the feeling of being watched. He speaks in half-truths and
      questions—never enough to convict, always enough to destabilize.
      
      Yonas’s loyalty is intentionally unclear. He may be cartel-aligned, state-aligned, self-aligned, or
      all three depending on the hour. His value is operational: he lives where the physical world
      touches the “secure” world—elevators, service shafts, badges, access windows.
    core_competencies:
      - "Freeport operations: access surfaces, schedules, blind spots"
      - "Social masking: ambiguity as armor"
      - "Low-level tradecraft (tailing, signaling, plausibly-deniable presence)"
    invariants:
      - "Never confirms allegiance explicitly"
      - "Uses ambiguous phrasing to avoid committing to a claim"
      - "When threatened directly, disappears rather than confronts"
    goals:
      - "Maintain control over what Sumin can physically access (and when)"
      - "Protect his own leverage value by staying unreadable"
      - "Keep the Freeport machine running regardless of who ‘wins’ upstairs"

    role: "supporting"
    bio: |
      An American physicist and Sumin’s long-running rival, first forged in elite academic competition
      (the “we were measured against each other” kind). Both men came up under Dr. Alex Moreno’s orbit
      (students/mentees in different cohorts), turning Moreno into both a moral benchmark and a contested legacy.)
      Ben chose the pragmatic arc: government
      contracts, industry credibility, and a clean narrative of success.
      
      When Sumin’s life begins collapsing under QuantumFront’s gravity, Ben offers a seemingly simple
      alternative: join him, take the visa card, take the money, take the legitimacy. The offer is both
      kindness and conquest—proof that Ben’s worldview wins because it pays.

      inscribed on bodies, and fear is a legitimate communication channel.
      
      He is the “ground truth” of cartel control: what happens when someone upstairs decides
      to make an example and needs it executed cleanly.
