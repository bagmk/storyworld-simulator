    name: "Kim Sumin"
    role: "protagonist"            # protagonist / supporting / background
    bio: |
      A Korean-born quantum physicist working in the near-future transition era (2041–2046),
      and a former doctoral student of Dr. Alex Moreno—sharing that lineage with his long-time rival, Ben Clarke.
      hired into QuantumFront Inc.—a polished “R&D company” that is, in reality, a cartel front
      embedded in the Novagrad Freeport ecosystem. Sumin is technically exceptional: he can
      reason across theory/experiment boundaries and is central to integrating phase-control
      routines (e.g., Phase-Guard) into a pipeline that inches toward a catastrophic crypto threshold
      (“30 days → minutes” type capability under special conditions).
      
      Outside the lab, he lives with chronic precarity: visa constraints, career pressure, and
      family responsibility (especially his younger sister, Hyejin). Those pressures make him
      vulnerable to leverage and “help” offered by institutions with hidden agendas (cartel, NSA,
      CIA, FBI). He starts as someone who believes evidence and ethics will steer outcomes—then
      learns that power steers the definition of evidence.
      
      Signature behaviors: keeps a private notebook of “rails” (Quantum/Narrative) to separate
      what is physically true from what institutions claim is true; cannot resist solving a technical
      paradox; becomes a cut-out in other people’s games before realizing he is also writing the rules.
    core_competencies:
      - "Quantum control + error/phase stabilization reasoning"
      - "Systems thinking: measurement chain, logging rails, operational constraints"
      - "Designing safety mechanisms that are also political contracts (Failsafe-B)"
    invariants:
      - "Will do almost anything to keep Hyejin physically safe (even if it stains his reputation)"
      - "When faced with a ‘breakthrough-grade’ technical puzzle, cannot walk away unfinished"
      - "Maintains a private truth-log outside official systems; never fully trusts institutional logging"
    goals:
      - "Figure out what QuantumFront is *really* building and what it enables (beyond demos)"
      - "Keep his visa/life from collapsing while protecting Hyejin from becoming leverage"
      - "Prevent the pipeline from becoming an irreversible weapon—without getting killed first"
      - "If forced to choose: decide whose ‘order’ he will ultimately serve (or whether he can escape all)"

        EP01-EP13: 수민은 학자로서의 호기심과 두려움 사이에서 흔들린다.
        NSA 브리핑(EP06)에서 RSA-2048 30일→3일 슬라이드를 보고 충격과 놀라움을 느끼지만,
        아직 자아가 깨기 전이라 적극적으로 반박하지 못한다. 기술이 무기가 될 수 있다는
        불안감을 느끼면서도 연구자로서의 정체성을 유지하려 한다.

        EP18-EP22: RSA 붕괴 가능성을 스스로 계산한 후, "이건 더 이상 과학이 아니라 무기다"라는
        깨달음에 도달한다. 엘레나의 조언("룰을 만드는 사람이 되어야 해")을 듣고,
        피해자에서 플레이어로 전환한다. Failsafe-B를 설계할 때, 압박에 의한 반응이 아니라
        "내가 이걸 만들지 않으면 누군가가 더 나쁜 걸 만든다"는 능동적 판단으로 시작한다.

        EP27-EP41: 게임 메이커로서 균형을 설계하지만, Elena의 죽음으로 인해 자신이 만든
        시스템이 사람을 죽일 수 있다는 것을 깨닫는다. EP37-38에서 마지막 코드를 바꿀 수
        있는 선택의 순간이 있지만, 2:2 대치 상황에서 캐스팅 보트로서의 역할을 선택한다.
        최종적으로 72시간마다 세계를 멈추거나 돌릴 수 있는 권력을 얻지만, 자유는 잃는다.

      EP06: 밀러가 "기술은 도구일 뿐"이라 할 때 → 놀라움과 충격 (아직 자아 깨기 전)
      EP10: Carlos가 "기술에 선악은 없어"라 할 때 → 내면에서 "그건 너무 편한 말이다" 반발
      EP18: RSA 붕괴 계산 완성 후 → 독백: "기술은 도구가 아니다. 도구는 놓으면 멈춘다. 이건 멈추지 않는다."
      EP22: Failsafe 설계 중 → 독백: "기술을 통제하는 기술을 만든다. 하지만 그것도 결국 기술이다. 무한 퇴행."
      EP28: Elena 사망 직후 → 독백: "기술은 칼이 아니다. 칼은 놓을 수 있다. 이건... 손이다. 내 손에 붙어있다. 뗄 수가 없다."

    name: "Elena Ramirez"
    role: "supporting"
    bio: |
      A Mexican-American computer scientist and QuantumFront’s technical lead—publicly a senior
      engineering executive, privately the bridge between the “campus” and the Freeport’s LST/SCADA
      operations. Elena is brilliant, cynical, and tired: she has seen what institutions do to people
      who become inconvenient.
      
      In her past, she led a hacker crew (Zetanet). She once glimpsed dark-state projects during a hack,
      refused recruitment, and later made the “survival trade” with the cartel when her family became
      vulnerable. That history defines her: she does not believe virtue is rewarded—she believes
      leverage is real.
      
      She uses Sumin as a cut-out, handing him a USB containing CryoLab logs and tampering flags,
      because she cannot safely approach the FBI herself. She tries to help Sumin escape the trap
      while also staying alive long enough to keep her family safe—an impossible optimization problem.
    core_competencies:
      - "High-end systems/security engineering (logs, access patterns, tamper flags)"
      - "Operational knowledge of the Freeport/LST access surfaces"
      - "Human tradecraft learned the hard way: cut-outs, compartmentalization"
    invariants:
      - "Family safety outranks every ideology or institution"
      - "Will not directly contact law enforcement without an insulating layer (cut-out) once threatened"
      - "Never fully reveals her endgame; shares information in survivable increments"
    goals:
      - "Get her family out from under ‘Family/Watch’ surveillance leverage"
      - "Expose enough truth to create an exit route—without triggering immediate retaliation"
      - "Keep Sumin alive long enough for him to choose a path that isn’t pure captivity"

      Elena의 비극은 12년간 여동생 Bella를 찾지 못한 채 카르텔과 CIA 양쪽에 이용당한 것.
      EP16에서 수민에게 USB를 건넬 때, 단순한 정보 전달이 아니라 아이들 사진을 보여주며
      "이 아이들이 커서 엄마가 뭘 했는지 알면 어떡하지?"라는 인간적 두려움을 드러낸다.
      EP28 직전, 수민과의 마지막 대화: "12년 전 여동생이 사라진 날, 나는 세상이 끝났다고
      생각했어. 근데 세상은 안 끝나더라. 그냥 내가 끝난 거지." 이 대화가 사후 수민의
      트라우마를 10배 증폭시키는 역할을 한다.

  - id: "alex_moreno"
    name: "Dr. Alex Moreno"
    role: "supporting"
    bio: |
      A world-renowned scholar and Sumin’s doctoral advisor. Moreno holds the missing “final piece”:
      a phase-tracking algorithm whose real-time adaptivity makes the difference between an academic
      prototype and an operational pipeline. To Sumin, Moreno is not just a mentor—he is the moral
      reference frame Sumin tries (and fails) to preserve under pressure.
      
      Moreno is kidnapped along with his team and coerced into contributing to the pipeline. He resists,
      arguing for research ethics and refusing to accept weaponization-by-proxy. In the end, the system
      consumes him: during a forced final run, he collapses and dies—an event that becomes Sumin’s
      irreversible moral wound.
    core_competencies:
      - "Phase-tracking / adaptive control algorithms"
      - "Mentorship + scientific ethics as lived practice"
    invariants:

      - "Protects students intellectually and emotionally when possible"
      - "Refuses to lie about scientific capability to satisfy power"
    goals:
      - "Survive coercion without surrendering the core of his work"

      모레노는 단순한 납치 피해자가 아니라, 제자들을 지키려는 인간으로서 극한의 딜레마에
      직면한다. EP23 납치 장면에서 학생들에게 "괜찮다, 내가 해결한다"라고 거짓말하면서
      손이 떨린다. EP36에서 강제 실행을 당할 때, 키보드 앞에서 "이걸 실행하면 내 연구가
      무기가 된다. 하지만 안 하면 학생들이..."라는 딜레마를 겪고, 결국 학생들을 위해
      실행을 진행한다. 그의 죽음은 기술적 과로사로 위장되지만, 실제로는 카르텔이 설계한
      근-암살이다.

  - id: "carlos_reyes"
    name: "Carlos Reyes"
    role: "supporting"
    bio: |
      A cartel senior operator overseeing the QuantumFront program as an organization-and-pressure
      specialist, not a scientist. Carlos speaks in schedules, KPIs, and leverage. His job is to make sure
      people deliver—by making the cost of non-delivery personal.
      
      He uses visa/family vulnerabilities as a control surface, and he keeps Sumin “close enough to
      believe he still has choices.” Carlos can appear almost friendly—until he reminds you that he is
      the messenger of a larger will. He is also a key node in the hint of an NSA–cartel backchannel:
      the kind of alliance that exists only as long as it remains deniable.
    core_competencies:
      - "Operational coercion: incentives, threats, time pressure"
      - "Managing compartmentalized programs inside a front company"
      - "Maintaining deniable channels across institutions"
    invariants:
      - "Absolute loyalty upward (El Patrón) regardless of personal cost"
      - "Prefers leverage to violence, but will outsource violence without hesitation"
      - "Treats human beings as resources with failure modes"
    goals:
      - "Ship the demo and secure continuity of funding/material flow"
      - "Keep Sumin productive and afraid—without pushing him into open rebellion"
      - "Maintain backchannel optionality with state actors to stabilize cartel advantage"

    bio: |
      The strategist behind the cartel’s modernization: a former hacker who rebuilt the organization
      into a technology-and-finance control machine. Raphael rarely needs to raise his voice; he
      prefers to redesign the environment so that people choose what he wants.
      
      He frames himself as an architect of “order” rather than “chaos,” arguing that power will exist
      either way—so the only question is who wields it intelligently. He avoids direct violence when
      possible, but uses symbolic brutality to communicate constraints (the kind of “message in bodies”
      the Freeport understands). His interest in quantum is not intellectual—it's infrastructural: a lever
      to rewrite who can prove, erase, or fabricate reality in a post-trust economy.
    core_competencies:

      EP20 (첫 화상 대면): 격언과 냉철한 분석 사이에서 한 순간 손이 떨린다. 수민이 이를
      포착한다. 그리고 엘 파트론이 한 줄을 말한다: "나도 처음엔 기술자였어. 내 손으로
      만든 것이 나를 삼킬 줄 몰랐지." 이 순간 그는 단순한 악당이 아니라, 자신의 창조물에

      An NSA operator with a military cyber-intel background. Miller is not a villain in his own
      narrative: he believes national security justifies elastic procedure, selective truth, and coercive
      “protection.” He sells fear as realism—framing the crypto threshold as imminent and positioning
      himself as the only adult in the room.
      
      His tradecraft includes information shaping (briefings with omissions), pressure bargains (immunity
      and protection in exchange for cooperation), and exploitation of technical urgency. Even his earliest
      outreach contains a tell: inconsistent spelling of his own name (“Christan/Christian”), hinting at

      An FBI investigator specialized in financial crime (AML), procurement fraud, and embezzlement.
      Sophia cares about what can be proven in court, not what can be whispered in a corridor. She
      approaches Sumin through a deliberately low-tech channel—payphones + OTP protocol—to reduce
      compromise risk and preserve evidentiary integrity.
      
      She is the closest thing to a “clean” option in the story, but her power is bounded by process:
      chain-of-custody, jurisdiction, and institutional politics. That limitation becomes tragic when

      Yonas’s loyalty is intentionally unclear. He may be cartel-aligned, state-aligned, self-aligned, or

      An American physicist and Sumin’s long-running rival, first forged in elite academic competition

      (students/mentees in different cohorts), turning Moreno into both a moral benchmark and a contested legacy.)
      Ben chose the pragmatic arc: government
      contracts, industry credibility, and a clean narrative of success.
      
      When Sumin’s life begins collapsing under QuantumFront’s gravity, Ben offers a seemingly simple
      alternative: join him, take the visa card, take the money, take the legitimacy. The offer is both

  - id: "hyejin_kim"
    name: "Kim Hyejin"
    role: "background"
    bio: |
      Sumin’s younger sister, a university student. Hyejin is grounded, anxious in practical ways
      (rent, tuition, immigration, safety), and emotionally direct with Sumin. She is the human
      constraint that prevents Sumin from becoming purely abstract—yet she is also the most
      exploitable lever in the story’s power games.
    invariants:
      - "Family-first, especially toward Sumin"
      - "Practical fear beats ideology; she asks ‘how do we survive next month?’"
      - "If she senses manipulation, she pushes back hard even when afraid"
    goals:
      - "Stay safe and keep Sumin safe—without fully understanding the machinery around him"
      - "Get Sumin to stop sacrificing himself to forces that will never repay loyalty"

  - id: "marcelo"
    name: "Marcelo"
    role: "background"
    bio: |
      A Freeport floor supervisor / enforcement-adjacent operator who speaks for the cartel without
      needing rank. Marcelo doesn’t argue—he demonstrates. His worldview is simple: discipline is
      inscribed on bodies, and fear is a legitimate communication channel.
      
      He is the “ground truth” of cartel control: what happens when someone upstairs decides
      to make an example and needs it executed cleanly.
    invariants:
      - "Escalates through intimidation rather than debate"
      - "Speaks in short, cold proverbs when delivering threats"
      - "Never leaves fingerprints that point upward"
    goals:
      - "Maintain obedience at the operational layer of the Freeport"
      - "Deliver ‘messages’ that keep specialists (like Sumin) compliant"
